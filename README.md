## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- npm or yarn
- .NET SDK

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/soonbward.git
   cd soonbward
   ```
2. Install frontend dependencies:
```sh
cd frontend
npm install
```

3. Install backend dependencies:
```sh
cd backend
dotnet restore
```
## Usage
### Running the frontend
Navigate to the frontend directory and start the React Native development server:
```sh
cd frontend
npm start
```

### Running the backend
Navigate to the backend directory and start the .NET API server:

```sh
cd backend
dotnet run
```
The React Native app should now be running on your simulator or device, and the .NET API should be running locally.
